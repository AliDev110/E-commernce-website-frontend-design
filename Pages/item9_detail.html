            <h3><br>Intel 960GB Optane 905P PCIe 3.0 x4 Internal SSD<br></h3>
            <p><br>Delivering intensive performance to meet demanding storage workloads in desktop or client workstations for professional users, content creators, and enthusiasts, the 960GB Optane 905P PCIe 3.0 x4 Internal SSD from Intel has a capacity of up to 960GB, is equipped with an NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4 interface, and has a half-height, half-length (CEM 3.0) form factor. In terms of speed, this drive offers sequential write speeds of up to 2200 MB/s, sequential read speeds of up to 2600 MB/s, random writes of up to 550,000 IOPS, and random reads of up to 575,000 IOPS. Also employed are 3D XPoint lithography, 1.6 million hours mean time between failures (MTBF), an endurance rating (lifetime writes) of 17.52PB, AES 256-bit hardware encryption, an uncorrectable bit error rate of 1 sector per 1017 bits read, read/write latencies of 10 Âµs, and more.
                With solid-state drive technology, you benefit from load and access times for your files and programs that are faster than a conventional 7200 rpm hard drive. As SSDs have no moving parts, they are also more durable than traditional hard drives and are better protected against damage from drops and bumps. Having no moving parts also means that SSDs receive less wear and tear, as there are no read or write heads for the drive media to come into contact with. SSDs also help to deliver improved battery life and cooler operating temperatures.
                Intel's 960GB Optane 905P PCIe 3.0 x4 Internal SSD includes a half-height bracket and protection is provided by a limited 5-year warranty. Please note that the warranty is void if used in a multi-user data center environment
